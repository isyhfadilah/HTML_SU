                        Trauma can leave deep emotional scars that are often difficult to understand and navigate. If you’re struggling to pinpoint the root causes of your triggers or find yourself overwhelmed by emotional responses you can’t quite explain, you’re not alone. Trauma affects people in different ways, and it can sometimes take years for the full impact to surface. The confusion and frustration of not fully understanding your emotional reactions can create additional stress, making it harder to heal.
